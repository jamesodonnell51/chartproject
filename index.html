    <!-- STORY -->
    <div class="container">
      <p>In a continuation of a months-long trend, workers in the food and retail sectors left their jobs in September at record rates. Over 863,000 workers in food service and accommodation quit in September, with the highest quit rate in the economy of 6.6 percent. Retail workers were close behind, with 685,000 workers leaving and a quit rate of 4.4 percent.</p>

      <p>Saru Jayaraman, President of the restaurant worker advocacy group One Fair Wage, says these rates reflect decades of poor conditions for restaurant workers. "They have left in the millions, because wages were too low, and risks were too high."</p>

    <!-- KICKER -->
    <div class="container footer">
    <p>According to a One Fair Wage survey of restaurant workers, 80 percent say that the only thing that could make them return to work would be a full minimum wage (rather than the lower tipped minimum wage), with tips on top. </p>
